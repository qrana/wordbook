This is a project still in development. It contains some bugs that will be addressed in the future. This README will be updated soon.

## TODO
    * Add option to create and use accounts
    * Add color scheme to the app
    * Add documentation
    * Add instructions to run app in production mode + build instructions
    * Add unit tests
    * Add e2e tests
    * Refactor code

## Dependencies
    * MongoDB
    * Angular
    * Express
    * Node.js

## Development server

Run `cd backend` and `npm run dev` to turn on the backend in development mode.

Then in another terminal run `cd frontend` and `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files (backend or frontend).
